# Customized NeoVim IDE w/ CoPilot and Dap Debugging.
> *Inspired* by ThePrimeagens "0 to LSP" video.

* It is almost just like in the video; I just added **GitHub Copilot**, **Dap debugging** and changed some keymaps.
* I only chose to go public for a select few people to use; but anybody, **feel free!**
* Dap debugging is setup for Python.**Edit dap configs in init.lua** to match your preferred language
* **Transparent** editor, with **rose-pine** colorscheme 
* **Must install ripgrep as a prereq**
