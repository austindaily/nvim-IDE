# Customized NeoVim IDE w/ CoPilot and dap debugging.
> *Inspired* by ThePrimeagens "0 to LSP" video. (I used same directory structure)

* Unlike ThePrimeagen's, GitHub Copilot is integrated, as is debugging for Python. I used dap for debugging, so feel free to **edit dap configs in init.lua** to match your preferred language. 
* Transparent editor, with rose-pine colorscheme (Catppuccine is also looks great with this) 
* **Install ripgrep as a prereq**
* This is for anybody to use. Enjoy!
