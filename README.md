# Customized NeoVim IDE w/ CoPilot and dap debugging.
> *Inspired* by ThePrimeagens "0 to LSP" video.

* It is almost just like in the video; I just added **GitHub Copilot**, **Dap Debugging** and changed some keymaps.
* Dap debugging is setup for Python.**Edit dap configs in init.lua** to match your preferred language
* Transparent editor, with rose-pine colorscheme 
* **Must install ripgrep as a prereq**
* I posted this for a select few people to use; but anybody, **feel free!**
