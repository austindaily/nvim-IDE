// Customized NeoVim IDE w/ CoPilot and dap debugging. // 
// Inspired by ThePrimeagens configuration and LSP-Zero. (I used same directory structure) //
// Unlike ThePrimeagen's, GitHub Copilot is integrated, as is debugging for Python. I used dap for debugging, so feel free to edit dap configs in init.lua to match your preferred language. // 
// This is a transparent editor, with rose-pine colorscheme (ElfLord also looks really cool on it.) //
// Install ripgrep as a prereq
// This is for anybody to use. Enjoy! //
